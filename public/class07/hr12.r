# hr12.r

# This script should use a function and a loop to create many models.

# Ref:
# http://www.ml4.us/cclasses/class07#hr

# Demo:
# R -f hr12.r

# I should try to generate a model from these inputs:
my_yr_i      = 2015
model_size_i = 25 # years

create_model = function(yr_i, size_i) {


  # The model should be written as a csv now.
  # The csv should look like: 'model2015.csv'
  return(TRUE)
}

create_model(my_yr_i,model_size_i)
