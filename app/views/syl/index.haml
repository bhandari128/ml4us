This site should teach you Machine Learning (ML), on Linux.

If you have Mac, you should be able to learn most of the material.

If you have Windows or a phone, you will be able to read most of the material.

Why is Linux best for ML?

Linux is designed to run many pieces of software simultaneously.

Both Windows and Mac are optimized to serve one person on one laptop.

If you take the time to master ML, you should learn the technology which
professionals use.

How is ML related to simultaneous processes?

Think about how Gmail detects spam.

First, the spam detector is waiting for messages from users.
Often a user will send a message, "This is spam".
Sometimes the user will say, "This not spam".

Second, the detector will learn from the spam, or not-spam.
It wants to 'know' why spam is spam.

Third, the detector wants to predict what is spam.
When it predicts your spam, it should put the probable-spam in your spam folder.

If I multiply this scenario by millions of users, it's easy to see
that the Gmail spam detector needs technology to support many
simultaneous processes.

If you are serious about ML, you should learn Linux.

Fortunately, you can use a simple ML project to teach yourself Linux.
