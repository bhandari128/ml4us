%p I saw something like this:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class04spark64'

%p For 2016 test data, I translate the above report into English:
%ul
  %li The Effectiveness of a Long-Only model is 7.81%

  %li The Effectiveness of Negative Logistic Regression predictions  is 2.18%

  %li The Effectiveness of Positive Logistic Regression predictions  is 9.98%

  %li So, for 2016, Logistic Regression beats Long-Only.

  %li The accuracy data is listed below:

  %li Total 2016 observation count: 186 ( 2016-01-04 through 2016-09-27)

  %li True Positive Count: 75
  %li True Negative Count: 19

  %li False Positive Count: 68
  %li False Negative Count: 23

  %li Accuracy is (75.0+19.0) / 185.0 is 51%
