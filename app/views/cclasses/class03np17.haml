%h2 Class03 Answer:
%h2 Write NumPy syntax which does something similar to the Pandas syntax below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class03pd48'  

%p I ran the above script and saw this:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class03pd49'

%p I can see that the above script creates a column named pctlag1 from closep.

%p Each time closep is observed, pctlag1 tells me how much closep has changed after the previous observation.

%p Also the script creates a similar column named pctlead.

%p I have two ways to understand pctlead.

%p The easiest way is to see pctlead is that it is a shifted version of pctlag1.

%p Or, today's pctlag1 is yesterday's pctlead.

%p Another way to see it is as a one day look into the future, for each day in the past.

%p Today, however, pctlead is unknown because closep for tomorrow is unknown.

%p So the above script uses Pandas shift() to help me compute pctlag1 and pctlead.

%p A way to compute pctlag1, pctlead using NumPy is displayed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class03np18'
