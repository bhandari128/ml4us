%h2 Class07 Answer:
%h2 Build a heuristic pctlead model from pctlag1, and date-features

%p I started this lab by writing a script which gets prices from Yaho and then builds features.

%p The features are the same features I used to build heatmaps:

%ul
  %li pctlag1
  %li Month-of-Year
  %li Day-of-Week

%p The script looks like this:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07hr11'

%p I ran it:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07hr12'

%p Next, I wrote a script to build a series of models for a series of years:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07hr13'

%p I ran it:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07hr23'

%p One way to visualize a model is to see it as a table, for a specific year, with 60 rows and three columns.
