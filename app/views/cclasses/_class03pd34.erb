# This script should mimic the SQL listed below:
# 
# -- Delete a row:
# DELETE FROM prices3 WHERE cdate = '2016-08-10';
# 
# -- Delete some rows:
# DELETE FROM prices3 WHERE cdate &lt; '2016-08-10';
# 
# -- Delete all rows:
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prices3; 
# DELETE          FROM prices3;
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prices3; 

# SQL lacks the ability to get data from the web.
# Pandas can get data from the web:

import pandas as pd

prices_df = pd.read_csv('http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=%5EGSPC')
prices_df.columns = ['cdate_s','openp','highp','lowp','closep','volume','adjp']

# I should setup prices3:
pred1_sr   = prices_df.cdate_s >= '2016-08-01'
prices3_df = prices_df.copy()[['cdate_s','openp']][pred1_sr]

# I should report:
print(prices3_df)

# Mimic
# DELETE FROM prices3 WHERE cdate = '2016-08-10';

row_sr      = ( prices3_df.cdate_s == '2016-08-10')
prices3_loc =   prices3_df.loc[row_sr]
prices3_df  =   prices3_df.drop(prices3_loc.index)

# I should report:
print(prices3_df)

# Mimic
# DELETE FROM prices3 WHERE cdate &lt; '2016-08-10';

rows_sr     = ( prices3_df.cdate_s &lt; '2016-08-10')
prices3_loc =   prices3_df.loc[rows_sr]
prices3_df  =   prices3_df.drop(prices3_loc.index)

# I should report:
print(prices3_df)

# Mimic
# -- Delete all rows:
# DELETE FROM prices3;

prices3_df  =   prices3_df.drop(prices3_df.index)

# I should report:
print(prices3_df)
