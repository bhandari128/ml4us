%h2 Class09 Answer:
%h2 Aggregate Data

%p This lab required some knowledge.

%p The main idea I implement here is that for each pair I should create groups of observations which are spaced 5 minutes apart.

%p Then I should use groupby() in Pandas to find mean of price for each group of observations.

%p I started this lab with a simple shell command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash mkdir -p ~fx411/csv/

%p Next I wrote the script listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09s20a'

%p A copy of the above script should be in the git repo at this location:

%p ~fx411/fx411/script/agg_zip.py

%p Also I should be able to see it here:
