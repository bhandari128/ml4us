%h2 Class07 Answer:
%h2 Build a Logistic Regression model from pctlag1, and date-features.

%p I started this lab by writing a script which gets prices from Yaho and then builds features.

%p The features are the same features I used to build heatmaps:

%ul
  %li pctlag1
  %li Month-of-Year
  %li Day-of-Week

%p The script looks like this:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07hr11'

%p I ran it:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07hr12'

%p Next, I wrote a script to create Logistic Regression models for a series of years.
%p The script then uses the models to generate predictions for each year.
%p The predictions are stored in CSV files with names like predictions2016.csv.
%p Then, the predictions are aggregated so I can sum both effectivness and accuracy of the models.
%p The script is listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07logr11'

%p I ran it:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class07logr12'

%p I can see from the above output that ...
