%h2 Class01 Lab Answer:
%h2 As Product Manager, Enhance mlcl2

%p The data used by mlcl2 are simple measurements of flowers.

%p I find the data uninteresting compared to data about sports or stock market behavior.

%p As Product Manager, the only kind of user I act for is the Machine Learning student.

%p From that perspective, some enhancements to mlcl2 are easy to see:

%ul
  %li In slice_train_test.py, randomize rows read from iris.csv
  %li In slice_train_test.py, read all columns instead of just f0, f1
  %li In slice_train_test.py, encode iris_type column as integers: 0,1,2
  %li cp learn.py to learn_predict_linr.py
  %li In learn_predict_linr.py, I should learn from all independent variables: f0, f2, f3, iris_type_i
  %li In learn_predict_linr.py, I should predict immediately after the model is ready
  %li cp learn_predict_linr.py learn_predict_logr.py
  %li Enhance learn_predict_logr.py so it classifies iris_type_i
  %li cp compare.py rpt_accuracy.py
  %li Enhance rpt_accuracy.py so it reports accuracy of learn_predict_logr.py
  %li Use 3 colors visualize iris_type_i in 2D scatter plots of f0, f1, f2, f3
