Data Frames

Description:

     This function creates data frames, tightly coupled collections of
     variables which share many of the properties of matrices and of
     lists, used as the fundamental data structure by most of R's
     modeling software.

Usage:

     data.frame(..., row.names = NULL, check.rows = FALSE,
                check.names = TRUE,
                stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors())
     
     default.stringsAsFactors()
     
Arguments:

     ...: these arguments are of either the form ‘value’ or ‘tag =
          value’.  Component names are created based on the tag (if
          present) or the deparsed argument itself.

row.names: ‘NULL’ or a single integer or character string specifying a
          column to be used as row names, or a character or integer
          vector giving the row names for the data frame.

check.rows: if ‘TRUE’ then the rows are checked for consistency of
          length and names.

check.names: logical.  If ‘TRUE’ then the names of the variables in the
          data frame are checked to ensure that they are syntactically
          valid variable names and are not duplicated.  If necessary
          they are adjusted (by ‘make.names’) so that they are.

stringsAsFactors: logical: should character vectors be converted to
          factors?  The ‘factory-fresh’ default is ‘TRUE’, but this can
          be changed by setting ‘options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)’.

Details:

     A data frame is a list of variables of the same number of rows
     with unique row names, given class ‘"data.frame"’.  If no
     variables are included, the row names determine the number of
     rows.

     The column names should be non-empty, and attempts to use empty
     names will have unsupported results.  Duplicate column names are
     allowed, but you need to use ‘check.names = FALSE’ for
     ‘data.frame’ to generate such a data frame.  However, not all
     operations on data frames will preserve duplicated column names:
