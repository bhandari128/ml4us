I should show how to fit a line to two points.

The two points which interest me are the first trading day in 2016 and the most recent trading day in 2016.

mkdir -p ~/tmp/c3
cd       ~/tmp/c3

I should get prices from yahoo:

TKRH='%5EGSPC'
TKR='GSPC'
rm -f ${TKR}.csv

wget --output-document=/tmp/${TKR}.csv http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=${TKRH}
echo 'cdate,cp'                                           > ${TKR}2.csv
grep -v Date /tmp/${TKR}.csv|awk -F, '{print $1 "," $5}' >> ${TKR}2.csv

I should plot all prices from 2016.
